# Fint.DotNet.Example

This project contains an example application using FINT APIs.  This application presents a birthday
tool under `http://localhost:5000/api/birthdays` with two features:

 - `/jubilants` -- employees with round numbered birthdays this year
 - `/today` -- employees with birthdays today.

 OAuth and API endpoint configuration is in the file `Config/OAuthSettings.cs`.
